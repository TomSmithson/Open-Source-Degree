# Open-Source-Degree

## Overview

### Why am I doing this?
I feel that to excel in my future and my career I need to be doing lots of work outside of my University time, this is why I am going to try and study for the MIT Computer Science Degree by doing all of the modules that an MIT student would be doing. I am going to attempt to complete this before the end of my actual degree that I am studying at University in the UK. I am about to enter my second year at University, which gives me around two years to complete the content in the MIT degree.
During COVID, there has been lots of uncertainly and need to highly skilled professionals, so this has given me the motivation to study hard and achieve the best I can with the time that I have.

### What do I hope to gain?
In taking on this project, I hope to gain valuable mathematical, computer science, electrical engineering and physics skills that are going to allow me to excess in the future. As I learn more and take more notes, I will be uploading them to this repository in the hope that in a few years I will be able to show future employers the hard work that I put in during my degree to not only complete one computer science degree but two in the process. I think this will show my dedication to the subject and my ability to manage my time effectively and learn at a rapid pace.

### Will it be hard?
Yes.
